        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>With the increasing use of technology in education, ensuring student engagement has become a major challenge. 
        Our AI-powered system helps teachers monitor student attention in real time using computer vision and deep learning techniques.
        The system detects student emotions, tracks attention levels, and provides insightful reports to improve learning outcomes.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Our system utilizes facial recognition and emotion analysis to monitor students during class. 
        By analyzing expressions and tracking eye movement, the system determines the attentiveness of each student. 
        The system integrates with classroom CCTV feeds to ensure seamless real-time monitoring and provides detailed reports for each student at the end of the session.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>Teachers can monitor different classrooms and track student attention levels effectively. 
        Each studentâ€™s focus is analyzed, and those with significantly low attention spans are highlighted for early intervention. 
        The system generates attention reports using bar and line charts, helping educators make data-driven decisions. 
        Using AI and deep learning (CNN), the model is trained to recognize patterns in student engagement, 
        ensuring accurate and real-time results.</p>
